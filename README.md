# Image Component Detection with Streamlit and PyTorch

![Demo](demo.png)

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Streamlit application for image component detection using a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model implemented in PyTorch. Users can upload an image, analyze it using the model, and display detected component names.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:

- Python 3.6+
- Streamlit
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Pillow

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
